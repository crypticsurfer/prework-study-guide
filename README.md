Boot Camp Pre Work Study Guide

I createds this prework study guide to help me through the prework and as a reference for me to use through the bootcamp I am about to undertake. It has my notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.

## Usage

To use this study guide, I will look at my notes on each section and continue to add more as I go through the bootcamp. If I can't pick a topic to study I will use the DevTools in chrome to help me decide. Command Shift I will bring up the control panel where I will see a topic to study under the list of topics in the study guide.
